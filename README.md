Key Features to Remember:-
1. Authentication and Security should be provide by jwt.
2. Cache should be implemented either one of these ( 1.HazelCast Cache
                                                                                      2.Redis Cache)
3. Unique id should be in String format and prefix is same as entity name
     ex- Employee id be like emp0001,emp0002 .....
4. Swagger should be implemented.
5. Use Mysql for database.
6. Use gradle for project build.
7.employee photo comes in String format ex- https://whasfaljh.com
